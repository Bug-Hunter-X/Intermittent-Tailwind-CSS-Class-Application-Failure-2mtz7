// Solution:  Check Tailwind configuration, purge unused styles, and inspect CSS specificity.
// Ensure correct import of Tailwind classes and address any potential conflicting styles.
// Clear browser cache, rebuild your project, and carefully review CSS for potential specificity or order issues. 
// Consider simplifying CSS and carefully check the order of stylesheets to resolve conflicts
// Example showing careful selection of classes and order (this might not fix the original issue but demonstrates proper practice)
