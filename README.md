# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are intermittently not applied, even when correctly implemented.  The issue is difficult to reproduce consistently, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

The problem lies in the unpredictable application of Tailwind classes.  In some instances, classes are ignored, resulting in unexpected styling.  This behavior is not related to any obvious errors in the class names or Tailwind configuration.

## Reproduction Steps

Reproducing this bug is inconsistent. The provided example may or may not exhibit the issue on different systems or after code changes. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for potential conflicts:

1. **Purge Unused CSS:** Ensure that the Tailwind CSS purge mechanism is correctly configured to only include used classes, preventing conflicts from unused styles.
2. **Specificity Issues:** Look for specificity issues where more specific styles override Tailwind classes. 
3. **CSS Order:** Verify the order of CSS files. Tailwind should come after other custom styles to override them. 
4. **Caching Issues:**  Clear the browser cache or use a different browser to rule out caching as a source of error.
5. **Plugin Conflicts:** Check for conflicting plugins or custom CSS rules that may interfere with Tailwind's application.
6. **Correct Import:** Double-check if you are correctly importing the necessary files from your `tailwind.config.js` file.

By addressing these points and thoroughly investigating potential CSS conflicts, the unpredictable application of Tailwind classes can be resolved.
